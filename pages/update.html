		Hey there, I hope you doing fine. I have some useful updates for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Expected reading time: 1-2 min
	</p>
	<p>
		Updates briefly:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			From now you can use keyboard shortcut to activate one mode - though, you need to enable it first <a class="in_text_link" href="#">in options</a>. Command is <span>Alt + x</span> - after you use it some time, please, let me know, what do you think, would it better to make shrotcut command toggle mode(activate/deactivate) instead. Do you need one more shortcut combination for another mode or you fine with favourite one? Would you like to set up your custom key combination?
		</li>
		<li>
			Now you can also see at extension's icon what mode is active on current page. [E] for Easy and [H] for Hard one.
		</li>
		<li>
			It will be easier for you to be updated. I started <a href="#" class="in_text_link">twitter</a>. I'm gonna write there about future updates and start discussions so it will be easier for both me and you to contact each other. You can read and comment <a href="#" class="in_text_link">my thoughts</a> about automatic mode I'm going to implement for example.
		</li>
	</ul>
